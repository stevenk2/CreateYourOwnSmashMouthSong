a planet on the go it's ok watching the weeds grow and if you listen really hard the earth she hums when it's dark sleeping on the sidewalk the hope they call doctors and lawyers race for the ball and I don't even want to understand it all I just want to see all the little kids gettin' down to the rhythm the boys all shined up chasin' down the women a paper boy smilin' at the job that he's given the bugs in the grass and the birds all swimmin' mister moon checkin' on how y'all livin' the stars all winkin' at the day that's dimmin' I just want to see the aquaducts overflown watching the branches and dolls go home and if you listen really well the earth she speaks when she's pale sleeping on the ceiling the flies don't fall dust bunnies found their way to a wall and I don't even want to understand it all I just want to see (repeat chorus) sleeping on the sidewalk the home they call home they call doctors and lawyers race for the ball and I don't even want to understand it all I just want to see I just want to see.
